A tree is :

Full: every node either points to zero or 2 nodes.

Perfect: every node is completelly filled all the way across.

Complete: if filling tree from left to right

There is no rule that a tree has to be binary tree

Every node can only have one parent

A binary search tree has all node on right is greater then parent and all nodes on left is lesser than parent.
