In a heap,
	each node is greater then it's descendents
	there is no order of nodes.
	can contain duplicates.
	it's always complete

Max heap will have maximum value at root, while mean heap will have mean value at root.


leftChild = 2*parentIndex
rightChild = 2*parentIndex+1


parentIndex = integer division by child node.
